					For an employee in nonpay status, coverage continues at no cost for up to 12 months in
					nonpay status. However, if while in nonpay status the employee receives pay during any
					part of a pay period, the employee is not considered to be in nonpay status for FEGLI
					purposes. Coverage is terminated after employee has been in nonpay status for 12 months.
					Previous time in nonpay status counts toward the 12 months if employee did not return to
					duty for at least 4 consecutive months.

					If an employee is in active-duty military status while in civilian nonpay status, FEGLI

						>Public Law 110-181</a
					> the employee may elect to continue FEGLI coverage for an additional 12 months by paying both
					the employee and agency premiums for Basic coverage and by paying the entire cost of Optional
					coverage. You must give the eligible employee an opportunity to elect the additional 12 months
					as soon as possible before or after the employee enters nonpay status, but no later than before
					the end of the first 12 months in nonpay status.
