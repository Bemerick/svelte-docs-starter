## Chapter 1: The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions

### Subchapter 1: Introduction to this Guide

1. Authority
   The Office of Personnel Management's authority to prescribe reporting requirements covering personnel actions is in section 2951, title 5, United States Code. Section 9.2, civil service rule IX, is based on that statute and extends this authority to all types of appointments and personnel actions. In addition, Executive Order 12107 delegates to the Office of Personnel Management the authority to prescribe regulations relating to the establishment, maintenance, and transfer of official personnel folders.

### 2. Coverage

“The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions” (Guide) contains the Office of Personnel Management’s instructions on how to prepare personnel actions. Agencies may supplement the Guide with additional instructions and may require personnel action documentation in addition to what is called for in the Guide. However, in no case may an agency document derogatory or medical information on a personnel action if the information is not authorized by this Guide. As referenced throughout this Guide, the term Official Personnel Folder (“OPF”) is inclusive of an approved electronic equivalent of the same (i.e., eOPF).

## 3.Documentation of Personnel Actions

1.  **Request for Personnel Action**. For most of the personnel actions you process, there will be a Request for Personnel Action, Standard Form 52, or a similar agency form approved by the Office of Personnel Management as an exception to the Standard Form 52. The Standard Form 52 is usually initiated by the office or supervisor who wants to take a personnel action, such as the appointment of an employee; occasionally the personnel office initiates the form. The requester completes one part of the Standard Form 52 and forwards it to others (such as the budget office) whose approval is required by the agency. The form is then sent to the personnel office for review and clearance by classification, staffing, and other personnel specialists, and for signature by the individual(s) to whom authority to approve personnel actions (appointing authority) has been delegated. Chapter 4, of this Guide, explains how to complete the Standard Form 52; if your agency has an exception to the Standard Form 52, approved by the Office of Personnel Management, the instructions in Chapter 4 apply to it as

well. After the Standard Form 52 has been completed and the requested action has been approved, the form is sent to the personnel clerk or assistant who uses it to process the action in the agency’s automated personnel system.

1. **The Notification of Personnel Action Standard Form 50**, Standard Form 50-B, list form of notice, or an exception to one of these forms approved by the Office of Personnel Management, constitutes official documentation of Federal employment. Chapter 4, of this Guide, explains how to complete the Standard Form 50 and list form of notice. If your agency has an exception to the Standard Form 50 approved by the Office of Personnel Management, the instructions in Chapter 4 apply to it, as well.

   1. The Notification of Personnel Action must be prepared for all accessions, conversions, and separations - nature of action codes beginning with 1, 5, or 3 - and for all corrections and cancellations of these actions. For these actions, the Notification of Personnel Action is required both as official notification to the employee and as official documentation of the action. The employee must receive a Notification of Personnel Action for these actions. A copy of the Notification of Personnel Action must be filed on the right side of the Official Personnel Folder. Accessions and separations due to mass transfer may be documented by a list form rather than the Standard Form 50.
   1. The Notification of Personnel Action is not required for the following actions:

      0. Exception to Reduction in Force Release;
      1. Realignment;
      2. Recruitment Incentive;
      3. Relocation Incentive;
      4. Retention Incentive;
      5. Referral Bonus;
      6. Student Loan Repayment;
      7. “Individual” or “Group” Time Off Award
      8. Individual Cash Award (“RB” or “NRB”);
      9. Group Award (“Ch 45” or “Other”);
      10. Lump Sum Performance Payment (“RB-ILPA”, “RB-NILPA”, or “NRB”);
      11. “Individual” or “Group” Suggestion/Invention Award;
      12. Foreign Language Award
      13. Travel Savings Incentive; and
      14. Senior Executive Service Performance Award.

These actions are not documented on the right side of the Official Personnel Folder. At the agency’s option, they may be documented on the left side of the Official Personnel Folder while the person is employed in the agency. Agencies may choose to use the Notification of Personnel Action to notify employees of these actions or they may choose other methods of notification. Other notification methods must meet the requirements in Chapter 4 of this Guide.

1. For all other actions, the Notification of Personnel Action must be prepared and filed on the right side of the Official Personnel Folder. Agencies may choose to notify employees of the action with a copy of the Notification of Personnel Action or with another method that meets the requirements in Chapter 4 of this Guide.

1. **Enterprise Human Resource Integration.** Much of the Standard Form 52 and Standard Form 50 information is collected to meet Government-wide human resource information needs. This information is reported to Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI), a centralized automated information system that provides statistics on Executive Branch employment to the Congress, Office of Personnel Management, and other agencies. This information is used in a variety of ways to evaluate and formulate human resource systems and programs. Unless specifically authorized in the operating manual, [The](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url%3DHR-Reporting) [Guide to Human Resources Reporting Requirements](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url%3DHR-Reporting), all personnel actions described in this Guide are reported in EHRI dynamics submissions.

1) ## <a name="_bookmark4"></a>**Nature of Actions, Legal Authority and Remarks**
   Each chapter on processing actions contains instructions on how to select the nature of action, the legal authority(ies), and the remarks for the action. A complete list of natures of action (both the full and the abbreviated

versions), the legal authorities, the remarks, and their associated codes is published in [The Guide to Personnel Data Standards](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url%3DData-Standards).

1. Nature of Action

   1. The nature of action (NOA) is the phrase that explains the action that is occurring (such as “appointment” or “promotion”). Each nature of action has a unique numerical code that identifies, for statistical and data processing purposes, that particular nature of action. Each time a table directs you to enter a particular nature of action on a Standard Form 52 or Standard Form 50, you must also enter its code.
   1. The first digit of the nature of action code indicates the type of action:

      0. 100 series—appointments
      1. 200 series—returns to duty from nonpay status
      2. 300 series—separations
      3. 400 series—placements in nonpay and/or nonduty status
      4. 500 series—conversions to appointment
      5. 600 series—(reserved for Office of Personnel Management use)
      6. 700 series—position changes, extensions, and miscellaneous changes
      7. 800 series—pay changes and miscellaneous changes
      8. 900 series—(Reserved for use by agencies)

The second and third digits of the nature of action code indicate the particular kind of action, for example, “promotion,” “resignation,” etc.

1. Nature of action codes 000-899 may be used only as authorized by the Office of Personnel Management. Within the 000-899 group of codes are ones used to record actions involving particular groups of employees. If your agency is authorized to use any of these special codes, your personnel office will have a list of them and instructions on when and how they are to be used.

1. `	`Codes 900-999 may be used by agencies to document personnel matters that are of interest to the agency and for which the Office of Personnel Management does not require a Standard Form 50, for example, a change in the employee's position number when no other change occurs, or a change in the appropriation from which the employee is paid. In general, a Standard Form 50 documenting a 900 series action may not be filed on the right side of the Official Personnel Folder (OPF). The exception is when an agency uses the Standard Form 50 instead of an agency form to document something that is approved for long-term Official Personnel Folder retention. An example is completion of the supervisory or managerial probationary period. Actions in the 900 series are not reported in Enterprise Human Resources Integration dynamics submissions.
1. Legal Authority
   1. The legal authority is the law, Executive Order, regulation, agency directive, or the instruction under which the personnel action is taken. While the nature of action identifies the personnel action, the authority identifies the specific circumstances under which the action is taken. Agencies and the Office of Personnel Management use this kind of information to perform their personnel management functions.
   1. Each authority has a unique alphabetical or numerical code to identify it for statistical and data processing purposes. Each time a table tells you to use a particular authority, you must also use the code. When more than one authority and code is required, you must enter them on the Standard Form 52 and Standard Form 50 in the order in which they are listed in this Guide.
   1. Legal authority codes beginning with an alpha character (meaning a letter), and those beginning with the numbers “1” - “5,” are reserved for use by the Office of Personnel Management to identify authorities on actions that are reported to Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI). An agency may create its own legal authority codes, using “6,” “7,” “8,” or “9” as the first character of the code, to identify an authority unique to the agency. Such an authority may be cited on an action _only_ when the action is one that is _not_ reported to EHRI _or_ when the authority is to be cited as the _second_ one on an action that is reported to EHRI. Agencies

creating internal legal authority codes using “6,” “7,” “8,” or “9” as the first character of the code, to identify an authority unique to the agency, must also coordinate the creation and use of the codes with the Office of Personnel Management via e-mail at <persaction@opm.gov>. Coordination requests are to include a completed form 1828 or 1828a along with supporting documentation.

1. To obtain the legal authority code to be cited for a new law, regulation, Executive Order, or other authority on an action that will be reported to EHRI, contact the Data Elements Program Manager within the Office of Personnel Management’s Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) office at <DataElementRequest@opm.gov>. Requests submitted are to include completed form 1828 or 1828a, along with supporting documentation for the request submission.
1. **Remarks**

   1. Remarks are put on the Standard Form 50 to explain the action to the employee, the payroll office, future employers, the Office of Personnel Management, and to other Federal agencies. For some actions, specific remarks are always required; for others, the remarks will vary according to the employee's work history. Tables in the chapter that covers the action will tell you how to select the necessary remarks and list them. The remarks used on documentation of personnel actions are standardized and agencies may not change or alter a remark listed in this Guide without the prior approval of the Office of Personnel Management. Except as noted below, agencies may supplement the remarks to explain actions.

      0. When an employee whose appointment does not afford appeal rights submits a resignation or retirement, or is separated by the agency, no agency reasons for or explanation of the separation (“agency finding”) may be placed on the action.
      1. When an employee whose appointment does afford appeal rights submits a resignation or retirement before receiving written notice of a proposed disciplinary or adverse action, no remarks regarding the proposal may be placed on the action.
      2. Remarks are identified in this Guide by codes for ease of reference. The first characters of the remarks codes indicate the

purpose for which the remark is used; the other characters of the code have no significance

| **_First Character_** | **_Remarks Explained_**                                                                   |

1. ## <a name="_bookmark5"></a>**Other Standard Form 50 Data**
   The Office of Personnel Management has developed standard codes to record other data on personnel action forms and to report data to Enterprise Human Resources Integration. These codes and their definitions are published in [The Guide to Personnel Data Standards](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url%3DData-Standards). Only the codes published in [The Guide to Personnel Data Standards](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url%3DData-Standards) and in this Guide may be used to document information in the following blocks of the Standard Form (SF) 52, SF 50, and SF 50-B:

| <a name="6._cancellations_and_retroactive_personn"></a><a name="7._need_for_accuracy_and_use_of_personne"></a>**_SF 52_** | **_SF 50/SF 50-B_** |

1. **Cancellations and Retroactive Personnel Actions**
   When a personnel action is determined to be in error, follow the instructions in Chapter 32 of this Guide regarding proper action to take.

1. ## **Need for Accuracy and Use of Personnel Action Data**
   1. Personnel action data are used by both employing agencies and the Office of Personnel Management. They are used by agency personnelists and managers to make decisions about employees, for example, whether a current employee is qualified for promotion, is eligible for reinstatement, etc. Agencies and the Office of Personnel Management's Data Analysis office use employee data, including nature of action and authority, to generate statistics providing a wide variety of information on the Federal workforce to the President, Congress, Office of Personnel Management personnel program managers, agencies, and to the public. This information is used to make policy decisions on personnel programs which affect current and future Federal employees. The data reported to Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) are also used by the National Personnel Records Center to provide locator and general reference service concerning Federal employees.
   1. To protect the interests of both the employee and the Government, it is critical that actions be documented correctly and that data on each action discussed in this Guide be reported to the Office of Personnel Management’s EHRI accurately and on a timely basis. The operating manual, [The Guide to Human Resources Reporting Requirements](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/#url%3DHR-Reporting),

explains how and when to submit data to EHRI. When personnel action data are received by the Office of Personnel Management, they are rigorously screened and edited. Lists of errors found in the screening process are sent back to the submitting agencies.

1. ## **Questions Regarding Unusual Cases**
   An agency’s Human Resources Office should direct questions to the Guide Program Manager, within the Office of Personnel Management’s Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) office at <persaction@opm.gov>.

### Subchapter 2: How to Use this Guide\*\*

1. **How the Guide is Organized**
   The first seven chapters of The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions (Guide) contain general instructions for processing personnel actions, including how to complete the Standard Form 52, Request for Personnel Action, and the Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel Action, and how to determine creditable service and calculate a service computation date.

Chapters 9 through 32 contain instructions for specific types of actions. Chapter 34, Topic Index and Chapter 35, the Glossary, are readers’ aids for using this Guide. The Topic Index helps identify the correct chapter where information is located and the Glossary defines terms.

Each specific type of action is covered in a separate chapter. Chapters 9 through 32 contain:

0. an introduction that explains the personnel actions covered by the chapter, and definitions of those actions;
1. step-by-step instructions on how to process the action, (decisions to be made and actions to be completed); and
2. tables to help you select the correct information to put on the Standard Form 52 and the Standard Form 50.

Most of the instructions and tables for a particular action are in the same chapter. There will be times, however, when you will have to look elsewhere. For example,

0. When a table in one chapter applies to several kinds of actions and the table has not been reprinted in other chapters, you will be told to turn to it.
1. Instructions regarding benefits are complicated and they are not reprinted. You are told where to find them elsewhere in Office of Personnel Management publications.
2. When general instructions apply to more than one kind of action, they have been combined in the first 7 chapters.
3. **Identification of Changes to the Guide**
   When revised pages are issued, new text changes and/or additions are identified in dark red font surrounded by angled brackets.

Deletion/removal of text are identified with three asterisks in green font

These designations are not usually used when an entire chapter is re-issued.
