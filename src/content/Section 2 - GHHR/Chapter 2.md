## Overview\*\*

Technical compliance is a collaborative process between the data provider and OPM to ensure that the HR, payroll, and training data submitted to OPM matches the specification detailed in the GHRR and is usable for OPM government-wide reporting purposes. The technical compliance process provides OPM with insight into the data available to providers and the way in which the data is stored across Agencies and Shared Service Centers (SSC). As needed, OPM updates the reporting requirements and system edits based on what is learned through technical compliance.

## Technical Compliance Process

The technical compliance process consists of the three steps depicted below.

**Step 1 – Communicate Need for Technical Compliance**

Changes to the GHRR, including updates to the record specifications, may prompt OPM to issue a requirement for a technical compliance review. Following the release of any update to the GHRR, OPM will communicate the associated technical compliance requirements. OPM may request data providers to submit a schedule on when they plan to meet any applicable technical compliance milestones.

**Step 2 – Test Data Submissions**

During the Technical Compliance phase, data providers are expected to send OPM several iterations of representative test data as they work their way through the technical compliance process. OPM will provide feedback to the data provider after each test data submission. OPM will work closely with providers during this step to ensure the provider is aware of the technical requirements of sending test data to OPM, including changes to Connect:Direct.

**Note: During the Technical Compliance phase, data providers should continue sending production files to OPM using the last approved version of the files.**

**Step 3 – Assess Production Readiness**

Following the completion of all required test data submissions, OPM will review findings of test data submissions, the status of open issues, and the providers’ plan for resolving those issues. If a provider is not approved to begin sending production data, OPM will provide specific feedback on what the provider needs to do to become compliant. If the provider is deemed to be technically compliant, the provider will proceed with the steps necessary to send production data to OPM.

## Maintaining Technical Compliance

Once a data provider is technically compliant and is sending production data into the data warehouse, OPM continuously monitors the quality of the data submissions across the HR, payroll, and training feeds. As specified in the quality control sections of this guide, OPM provides data quality reports to each provider on a regular basis. OPM reserves the right to revoke a provider’s technical compliance should the quality of the submitted data at any time be deemed less than acceptable. Prior to revoking a provider’s technical compliance, OPM will work closely with the agency/SSC to understand the issue(s) and provide adequate time for resubmissions.
