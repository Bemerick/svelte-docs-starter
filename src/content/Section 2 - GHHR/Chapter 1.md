## Chapter 1: General Instructions

1. Purpose
   Federal agencies should rely on this guide to prepare and submit human resources (HR), payroll and training data files to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) data warehouse.

This guide provides information on the file structure for the data files and clear instructions for transferring those files to OPM. Essentially, this guide is an Interface Control Document (ICD). It is an agency and Data Providers source for the HR (Status and Dynamics), payroll, and training data requirements and for determining how to correct data exceptions (i.e., errors) in those files.

The other purpose for this guide is to record how OPM responded to new policy demands for employee data. A “Revision Sheet,” found at the beginning of each chapter, will record how OPM responded to a change in policy. It will be used to log revisions to a chapter, and it will have an “effective date” plus a “description” of the revision. Having a revision sheet is significant because it manages our institutional knowledge of data requirements over time.

1. Background
   The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) Program's Data Warehouse is the Government's premier source for integrated Federal workforce information. The system currently collects, integrates, and publishes data for 2.0 million Executive Branch employees on a bi-weekly basis, supporting agency and government-wide analytics. In addition, the system provides Federal workforce data to other Government systems and processes dependent upon the integrated data. The OPM Data Warehouse architecture provides a flexible, scalable, and secure environment for current and future Government requirements, and expansion is planned through the addition of new federal employee populations, new data elements, improved data integration and data quality processes, and by enabling new system interfaces that utilize industry best-practice architectures.

1. Privacy
   The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) carefully protects EHRI data to safeguard employees' privacy. EHRI is part of an OPM/Government-wide system of records (OPM/GOVT-1, General Personnel Records) under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. The Act requires that agencies publish Federal Register notices describing these systems of records, their uses, and the ways people can access the records. The Privacy Act notice is available at <https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/#url=Web-Privacy-Notice>
