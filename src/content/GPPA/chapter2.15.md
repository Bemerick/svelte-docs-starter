This chapter covers furloughs, and extensions of furloughs, placements in leave without pay status and extensions of leave without pay, suspensions, written warnings and civil penalties under [Section 9204 of title 5, U.S. Code](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section9204&num=0&edition=prelim#sourcecredit), placement of seasonal employees in nonpay and nonduty status at the end of a peak workload period, sabbaticals for employees in the Senior Executive Service, and absent-uniformed service actions ([38 U.S. Code, chapter 43](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title38-chapter43-front&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CMzggVVND%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7CdHJ1ZQ%3D%3D%7C3053%7Ctrue%7Cprelim)).

It does not cover:

1. Changes to service computation dates for leave, when time in a nonpay status exceeds six months during a calendar year. (See Chapter 6 for instructions.)
1. An employee using annual or sick leave. No personnel action is required to document use of annual leave or use of sick leave.

## 3. election of Legal Authority

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Meaning of “equivalent to CS Regs.”

For some actions covered by this chapter, the legal authority you place on the action indicates it is being taken under Civil Service laws or regulations, under agency procedures that are similar or equivalent to those required under Civil Service laws or regulations, or under other procedures. The rule you follow to select the legal authority will depend upon your knowing what procedures are being used. For example, you may have to know if the action is being taken under “[5 U.S.C. 75](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title5-chapter75-front&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjUgc2VjdGlvbjo3NTAxIGVkaXRpb246cHJlbGltKSBPUiAoZ3JhbnVsZWlkOlVTQy1wcmVsaW0tdGl0bGU1LXNlY3Rpb243NTAxKQ%3D%3D%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim)” (chapter 75 of title 5 of the U.S. Code, “Adverse Actions”),under agency procedures that are equivalent to [5 U.S.C. 75](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title5-chapter75-front&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjUgc2VjdGlvbjo3NTAxIGVkaXRpb246cHJlbGltKSBPUiAoZ3JhbnVsZWlkOlVTQy1wcmVsaW0tdGl0bGU1LXNlY3Rpb243NTAxKQ%3D%3D%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim) (“5 U.S.C. Eq”), or under other procedures. There are some agencies that are not covered by the Civil Service laws and regulations, and there are some employees who are not covered because of the appointments on which they serve. If your agency is not covered by Civil Service procedures, or the employee who is the subject of the action is not covered, your agency may have used other procedures that are different from those required by the Civil Service laws or regulations. If you are not sure whether your agency, or whether the employee who is the subject of the action, is covered by Civil Service procedures applicable to that particular action, or by equivalent agency procedures, ask the personnel specialist who approved the action. _You cannot determine the correct authority without knowing the procedures being used to effect the action_.

1.  **Actions for Which the Agency Must Select the Authority**. For some actions covered by this chapter, you will be given a Legal Authority Code and be told to cite the appropriate authority. To document one of these actions, ask the personnel specialist who approved the action how that action was handled:
    1. If a specific law, Executive Order, or regulation was the basis for the action, that law, Executive Order, or regulation should be cited in the authority block on the [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf), along with the legal authority code shown in the table.
    1. If the agency has internal regulations, an agency manual, or an employee code of conduct or ethics that provides penalties for violations or misdeeds, cite the agency regulation or the agency manual or code of conduct reference in the authority block on the [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf) _along with the legal authority code shown in the table._ If the action is being taken under “[5 U.S.C. 75](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title5-chapter75-front&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjUgc2VjdGlvbjo3NTAxIGVkaXRpb246cHJlbGltKSBPUiAoZ3JhbnVsZWlkOlVTQy1wcmVsaW0tdGl0bGU1LXNlY3Rpb243NTAxKQ%3D%3D%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim)” (chapter 75 of title 5 of the U.S. Code, “Adverse Actions”).
    1. If the action is being taken under an authority that is unique to your department or agency, cite that authority (along with the authority code approved by the Office of Personnel Management) instead of the authority and code shown in this chapter.
    1. For actions where a specific legal authority is not cited in the table and where the action is not covered by paragraphs (1)-(2) above, show in the authority block on the [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf) “[5 U.S.C. 302](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:302%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section302)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>)”, along with the legal authority code shown in the table. ([5 U.S.C. 302](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:302%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section302)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>)) is the general authority for an agency head to delegate authority to take actions necessary to carry out personnel actions. Cite it only when no other authority is appropriate for the action being processed.

## 4. When to Process an Action

1.  Process a personnel action for:
    - Leave without pay of 80 hours or more granted because of an on-the-job illness or an on-the-job injury.
    - Leave without pay for uniformed service that is not subject to the provisions of [38 U.S.C. 4301](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title38-chapter43-subchapter1&f=treesort&fq=true&num=0&saved=%7CMzggVVND%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7CdHJ1ZQ%3D%3D%7C3053%7Ctrue%7Cprelim) et. seq.
