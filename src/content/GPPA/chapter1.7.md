## 2. Legal Basis for Preference

The legal basis for veterans’ preference is the Veterans’ Preference Act of 1944, as amended. The Act is now codified in [5 U.S.C. 2108](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=5+USC+2108&f=treesort&fq=true&num=10&hl=true&edition=prelim&granuleId=USC-prelim-title5-section2108#effectivedate-amendment-note) and other sections of title 5, United States Code. Preference applies to positions in the competitive service and in the excepted service. It does not apply in the Senior Executive Service, or to positions in the legislative and judicial branches of the Government. It also does not apply to positions in the Executive Branch which are required to be confirmed by the Senate. Preference is given in competitive examinations, in appointments to positions, and in retention during reduction-in-force. Other benefits to which preference eligibles are entitled include reinstatement in the competitive service and reemployment/restoration.

## 3. Recording Veterans’ Preference on the Standard Form 50

1.  An employee may have preference for appointment, adverse action, performance-based action or reduction-in-force purposes. Use Block 23 of the Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel Action, to document the preference for these purposes.
1.  Information is recorded in block 26 of the Standard Form 50 to indicate whether or not the employee is eligible for veterans’ preference during reduction-in-force procedures. When the employee is eligible, “Yes” is recorded. “No” is recorded on the Standard Form 50 when the employee is not eligible for preference for reduction-in-force, even if the employee has such preference for other purposes, such as adverse actions.
1.  Veterans’ preference is adjudicated on appointment. Use the Job Aid, Instructions for Documenting Veterans’ Preference on the Appointment Standard Form 52/50, to help document the correct information at the time of appointment/conversion.

# Subchapter 2. Change in Veterans’ Preference for Reduction in Force (RIF)

## 1. Coverage

This subchapter covers documentation of changes in veterans' preference that occur after the employee has entered on duty. These changes usually affect eligibility for veterans’ preference for reduction-in-force. If the veterans’ preference on the appointment was incorrect, process a correction to the appointment/conversion. (See Chapter 32 for instructions on how to process corrections.)

## 2. Use of SF 52

Although a Standard Form 52, Request for Personnel Action, is needed to process many actions, its use for Change in Veterans' Preference for Reduction-in-Force actions is optional. The Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel Action, for these actions can be prepared directly from the information in the employee's Official Personnel Folder (or in your agency's automated system) and the documents submitted by the employee in support of the change. When a Standard Form 52 is used, it is prepared in the personnel office and is used only as a working document to prepare the Standard Form 50. No requesting official signatures are needed.
