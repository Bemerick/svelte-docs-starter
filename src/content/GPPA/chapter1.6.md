# Subchapter 1. Determining Credible Service

## 1. Coverage

1.  This subchapter covers procedures for determining creditable service for leave accrual purposes. It explains how to:
    1. Identify prior service;
    1. Verify prior service; and,
    1. Determine if prior service is creditable for leave.
1.  Subchapter 2 explains how to compute a Service Computation Date for leave. Subchapter 3 explains when and how to process a personnel action to document a change in a Service Computation Date.
1.  Information on determining creditable service for other purposes is found in other issuances. These include:

       1. initial and supervisory probationary periods in [5 CFR 315](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-315).

## 2. Service Computation Date

    A Service Computation Date (SCD) is a date, either actual or constructed, that is used to determine benefits and is generally based on how long the person has been in the Federal Service. The SCD-Leave is used to determine the rate at which an employee accrues annual leave - 4, 6, or 8 hours per pay period - depending on the amount of service creditable for leave accrual purposes; however, it is not used to determine the accrual rate for employees occupying positions which are subject to [sections 5376](<http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:5376%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section5376)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>) or [5383 of title 5](<http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:5383%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section5383)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>), United States Code, or a pay system equivalent to either of the sections referenced as determined by OPM. Such employees accrue 8 hours of annual leave per pay period pursuant to [section 6303(f), title 5,](<http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:6303%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section6303)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>) United States Code. See [Fact Sheet: Annual Leave Accrual rates for Senior Executive Service, Senior Level and Scientific or Professional Positions, or Equivalent Pay Systems](<https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/annual-leave-accrual-rates-for-senior-executive-service-senior-level-and-scientific-or-professional-positions-or-equivalent-pay-systems/)>). Agencies must establish an SCD-Leave for each employee at appointment, whether or not the employee is eligible to earn leave. To establish the SCD, the agency must identify the employee’s prior Federal service, verify such service, determine how much, if any, of the service is creditable for leave accrual purposes, and then compute the SCD.

## 3. Identifying Prior Federal Service.

1. Application Review the employee’s application or resume to identify any prior Federal service. Federal service includes civilian and military service.
2. Standard Form 144 [(SF-144)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144.pdf) Ask each appointee to complete the [SF-144](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144.pdf), Statement of Prior Federal Service. This allows the employee to supplement the Federal service listed on his or her application.
3. Optional Form 306 [(OF-306)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144.pdf) Use information from the [(OF-306)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144.pdf), Declaration for Federal Employment, to determine if the employee is a military retiree.

## 4. Creditable Service

[Section 6303 of title 5,](<http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:6303%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section6303)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>) United States Code, sets the rules for crediting service for annual leave accrual. The law states: “In determining years of service, an employee is entitled to credit for all service of a type that would be creditable under [section 8332](<http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:8332%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section8332)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>), regardless of whether or not the employee is covered by subchapter III of chapter 83, and for all service which is creditable by virtue of subsection (e).” Creditable service falls into three general categories:

1. service as a civilian employee, that is, service under a Federal appointment performing Federal functions under Federal supervision,
2. active duty in the uniformed services; and
3. other service made creditable by specific legislation.

## 5. Creditable Civilian Service

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Types of Service.

All civilian service that is _potentially_ creditable for Civil Service Retirement Service (CSRS) purposes is also creditable for leave accrual. Potentially creditable includes service that could be credited if the employee made deposits to the Retirement fund. Such deposits are _not_ required before the employee gets credit for leave accrual purposes. Creditable civilian service for leave accrual includes service:

1. under a Federal appointment as defined in [section 2105 of title 5, United States Code](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:2105%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section2105)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>), whether in the competitive, excepted, or Senior Executive Service.
2. covered by CSRS or Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS) retirement deductions, including service for which the employee received a refund of the retirement deductions.
3. under other Federal retirement systems as long as the individual _could_ obtain a refund of his or her deductions under that system and deposit them in the CSRS fund. Civilian service under systems where the employee _cannot_ withdraw contributions, such as the DC Police and Firefighter System and the Financial Institutions Retirement Fund, is _not_ creditable.
4. listed in Chapter 20, Subchapter 20A of [The CSRS and FERS Handbook](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c020.pdf). This chapter contains detailed information on civilian service that is creditable for retirement purposes. Civilian service creditable for civil service retirement under [section 8332 of title 5, United States Code](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:8332%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section8332)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>), is also creditable for leave.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Amount of Service to be Credited.

In general, employees get a day of credit for each day of full time or part time service. Elapsed calendar time is the maximum time that can be credited. For example, if an employee has two part time appointments from January 1, 2022, thru March 31, 2022, credit is limited to three months. Special rules apply to short separations, absence for uniformed service or compensable injury, periods of nonpay/nonduty status, and service on an intermittent work schedule.

1. _Separations_ of three calendar days or less between two periods of creditable civilian service are to be credited. The separation period is treated as a continuation of the first period of service.
1. Employees who are absent because of _uniformed service or compensable injury_ are entitled to be treated as though they had never left. The regulations governing restorations to duty after uniformed service or compensable injury are in part [353 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-353). A person who is reemployed under [5 CFR 353](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-353?toc=1) receives credit for the entire period of his or her absence, that is, the entire period from the time the employee left until he or she was restored or reemployed.
1. Periods of _nonpay/nonduty status_ are credited to a maximum of six months per calendar year. Examples of nonpay/nonduty time include leave without pay, furlough, suspension, and placement in nonpay status. This limit does not apply to employees who are absent because of uniformed service or compensable injury. Periods of leave without pay for uniformed service or compensable injury are fully creditable for leave accrual.
1. _Intermittent_ service is service without a prearranged regularly scheduled tour of duty; this was also known as WAE or when actually employed service. Only the days or hours in pay or work status are credited for periods of intermittent service. The credit cannot exceed the calendar time of the period involved. For example, an intermittent employee who worked 100 hours in a 2-week period may not be credited with more than 2 weeks of service. Before 1980, on-call or seasonal work was differentiated from intermittent work by a remark on the [Standard Form (SF-50)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf) or in the employment agreement that indicated that “Service credit...for leave accrual continues up to a maximum of six months per calendar year.” If this or a similar remark is not shown on the [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf) or the employment agreement, the service is treated as intermittent.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Verifying Creditable Civilian Service

1.  Official Personnel Folder. If the application or [SF-144](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144.pdf) indicates prior civilian Federal service, follow the procedures in the Operating Manual, [The Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/#url=Personnel-Recordkeeping-GPR), to request the employee’s Official Personnel Folder. The Folder should include the documents used to verify prior service during the employee’s last appointment. [The Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/#url=Personnel-Recordkeeping-GPR) also contains instructions for requesting transcripts of service for civilian employment not under the Office of Personnel Management’s recordkeeping authority and for reconstructing Official Personnel Folders that have been lost.
1.  Postal Service Temporary Christmas Employment. Most Postal Service employment will be documented in the Postal Official Personnel Folder. The Postal Service does not create a personnel folder for temporary Christmas employees. To verify this employment, contact the Post Office where the employee worked or use payroll records. Payroll records can be obtained from (include in request employer name, city and state, and timeframe): National Personnel Records Center - Annex, Civilian Personnel Records Center, 1411 Boulder Blvd., Valmeyer, IL 62295.
1.  Other Documentation and Affidavits. If the agency is unable to locate any records to reconstruct an employee’s folder, the agency can use other documentation to provide credit for _civilian_ service _for leave accrual purposes only_. In these cases, the burden of proof is on the person claiming the service. Other documentation can include travel orders, payroll cards, credit reports that show the Federal employment, or affidavits. Affidavits are required from the employee and at least two other people who were in a position to know the facts of the employment, such as former supervisors. The affidavits must be notarized. Future employers will accept service verified by affidavit as they would any other service verified by a prior employer.

## 6.Creditable Uniformed Service

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.General Rule.

Active-duty uniformed service is generally creditable for leave accrual purposes. To be creditable the uniformed service must have:

1.  ended honorably. That includes: an honorable discharge or a discharge under honorable conditions (general) or transfer to the inactive reserves under honorable conditions.

         **and**

    1. been active duty in a uniformed service.
       1. The uniformed services consist of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, <a name="_hlk117058918"></a>Space Force) plus the commissioned officer corps of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
       1. Active duty is full time duty in the Armed Forces. In the Reserves this would include active duty for training but not weekly or monthly assemblies or drills. National Guard duty must be active duty in the service of the [United States under title 10, United States Code](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section10105&num=0&edition=prelim), or under a call by the President or Secretary of Defense. National Guard service or training under the call of the Governor of a State or performed for a State under [title 32](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title32&edition=prelim), United States Code, is _not_ creditable.
       1. Military service includes service as a cadet at the United States Military Academy, United States Air Force Academy, or United States Coast Guard Academy, or service as a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy. See full definitions at [5 U.S.C. 8331(13)](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:8331%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section8331)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>) and [5 U.S.C. 8401(31)](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:8401%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section8401)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true>).

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Restrictions on Credit for Military Retirees.

[Section 6303(e)(A)-(C) of title 5](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=section+6303+of+title+5&f=treesort&fq=true&num=26&hl=true&edition=prelim&granuleId=USC-prelim-title5-section6303), United States Code, restricts the amount of leave accrual credit military retirees receive for their active-duty service. This is an exception to the general rule that ties service credit for retirement and leave accrual. The creditability of uniformed service for leave accrual purposes differs from the creditability for civil service retirement purposes.

1. Definition of military retiree: For leave accrual purposes, a military retiree is any member or former member of the uniformed services who is entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer pay on account of service as a member. Uniformed services retirees include persons on their service’s Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) and Navy and Marine Corps personnel who have been transferred to the Fleet Reserve. Note that the definition is based on an entitlement; waiving the actual pay has no impact on whether the person is a military retiree.
1. Military retirees may receive credit **only** for:
1. All active duty when the uniformed services retirement was based on disability that _either_ resulted from an injury or disease received in the line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict _or_ was caused by an instrumentality of war and was incurred in the line of duty during a period of war as defined in [sections 101 and 301 of title 38, United States Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title38/html/USCODE-2011-title38-partI.htm). Verification that a military disability retirement was based on a disability received as a direct result of armed conflict or caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war should be provided by the employee’s branch of service. Figure 6-2 lists sources of information on whether a retirement from the uniformed services was based on war or combat-incurred disability.
1. Actual service during a war is creditable regardless of where the individual served or what duties were performed. For leave accrual credit purposes, “war” means only armed conflicts for which a declaration of war was issued by Congress. The last war declared by Congress was World War II which officially began on December 7, 1941, and ended on April 28, 1952.
1. Actual service while participating in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized. For example, if a military retiree was on active duty for the entire period of the Vietnam campaign but served in that campaign for 14 months, the retiree is entitled only to the 14 months campaign service credit. He or she is not entitled to credit for time on active duty outside of the campaign area. The [VetGuide](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/), available on the Office of Personnel Management’s website (<https://www.opm.gov>), contains a list of campaigns and expeditions.
1. All active duty when the uniformed services retiree was employed in a civilian position subject to the Leave Act on November 30, 1964, and has been continuously employed without a break in service of more than 30 days since that date.
1. All active duty when the individual first becomes eligible for a uniformed services annuity while serving as a civilian employee. This includes reservists who qualify for an annuity, as well as employees who are recalled to active duty, qualify for uniformed services retirement, and then are restored to Federal civilian employment. _This exemption applies only to the current period of civilian employment._ If the employee separates and is reemployed later, the restrictions will apply.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Appointments While on Military Terminal Leave

      1. **Employees Appointed on or after October 17, 2006, while on Terminal Leave Pending Retirement from the Uniformed Service ([Pub. Law 109-364, Section 1101](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-109publ364/pdf/PLAW-109publ364.pdf), dated 10/17/06).** Except under the limited conditions specified in [title 5, U.S. Code 6303(a)(A)-(C) or (e)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2015-title5/pdf/USCODE-2015-title5-partIII-subpartE-chap63-subchapI-sec6303.pdf), the uniformed service of such an employee is not creditable for purposes of determining the SCD-Leave.
      1. **Employees Appointed Prior to October 17, 2006, while on Terminal Leave Pending Retirement from the Uniformed Service (Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel Opinion dated October 16, 2007).** The employee’s uniformed service is creditable in determining the SCD-Leave at the time of appointment. However, upon the employee’s retirement from the uniformed service the employee’s uniformed service is no longer creditable in determining the SCD-Leave except under the limited conditions specified in title [5 U.S. Code 6303(a)(A)-(C) or (e)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2015-title5/pdf/USCODE-2015-title5-partIII-subpartE-chap63-subchapI-sec6303.pdf). See >Subchapter 2, Section 2, item h. For additional information see:[Compensation Policy Memorandum 2009-03](https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/rate-accrual-annual-leave-civilian-employees-hired-while-terminal-leave-pending-retirement_508.pdf).

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Verifying Creditable Uniformed Service

1. Uniformed service must be verified by the branch in which the person served and is generally done so using the DD 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty and the [Standard Form SF-813](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf813.pdf), Verification of a Military Retiree’s Service in Nonwartime Campaigns or Expeditions. Accordingly, agencies should direct inquiries regarding the uniformed services’ manner of documenting active-duty service (e.g., individual does not have a DD 214, confirmation on dates or nature of service, etc.) to the branch of the uniformed service in which the individual served. The Office of Personnel Management does not verify information on the dates or nature of uniformed service, type of discharge, or nature of any retirement from the uniformed service.
   1. Service in the Armed Forces is generally documented on the DD 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. This form shows the dates or total amount of active duty and the type of discharge or separation. If the employee does not have a copy of this form, he or she should obtain it from: National Personnel Records Center (Military), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138.
   1. When a retiree’s DD 214 does not show the exact dates of service in a campaign or expedition, use the SF-813, Verification of a Military Retiree’s Service In Nonwartime Campaigns or Expeditions, to request that information. The [SF-813](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf813.pdf) is available from the Office of Personnel Management’s website (<http://www.opm.gov/forms>). Ask the retiree to list the exact dates of their participation in the campaign area on the form and send the form in duplicate to the office listed on the reverse of the form.
   1. Dates of active-duty National Guard service should be documented on the DD 214 or on orders placing the employee on active duty. Copies of orders should be obtained from the Adjutant General for the State National Guard in which the employee served. The request may be on a [SF-180](https://www.archives.gov/files/standard-form-180.pdf), Request Pertaining to Military Records, and should include a statement that “The beginning and ending dates of honorable active ARNGUS or ANGUS duty and the authority of law under which it was performed under either a call by the President or an order by the Secretary of Defense (or his designee) are needed to verify prior Federal service credit for the named Federal employee.”
   1. Dates of active-duty Reserve service should be documented on the DD 214 for service of 90 or more consecutive days. Reservists are not provided a DD 214 for short periods of active duty, such as annual trainings. Because the chronological statement is an official document issued by the reservist’s branch of service, it may be used to verify active-duty service if it includes the dates of the service. Furthermore, active service can be verified by contacting DFAS for the employee’s earnings estimates for those periods of service.
   1. Dates of active-duty service as a Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Officer should be documented on PHS Form 1867, “Statement of Service-Verification of Status of Commissioned Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service.” After October 2021 service will be documented on a DD214. An e-mail can be sent to <mailto:phsdd214@hhs.gov> to request a copy of the DD 214.
   1. Dates of active-duty service as a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Commissioned Officer should be documented on NOAA Form 56-16, “Report of Transfer or Discharge.” The form can be obtained from: Commissioned Personnel Center, 1315 East West Highway, 10th Floor Silver Spring, MD 20910.

[Figure 6-2](#_figure_6-1a6-2._) lists sources of information on whether a retirement from the uniformed services was based on war- or combat-incurred disability.

## 7. Other Creditable Service

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. General.

Specific statutes have made some civilian service that does not meet the definition of Federal employment creditable for leave or retirement. The kinds of service that occur most frequently are described below in “b” through “h”. Detailed information on these types of service and the specific conditions that must be met for the service to be creditable are in [Chapter 20](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c020.pdf), Subchapter 20A of [The CSRS and FERS Handbook](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/#Administrative). Additionally, [section 6303(e) of title 5](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2015-title5/pdf/USCODE-2015-title5-partIII-subpartE-chap63-subchapI-sec6303.pdf), United States Code, as amended by [section 202(a) of the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/129) of 2004 ([Pub. Law 108-411](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-108publ411/pdf/PLAW-108publ411.pdf) dated October 20, 2004), permits a newly appointed or reappointed employee to receive credit for prior non-Federal service or active-duty uniformed service that otherwise would not be creditable towards determining the SCD-Leave. Such service is described in “h” below.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. National Guard Technician Service.

This has been Federal service since January 1, 1969. All those who have served in a National Guard Technician position since January 1, 1969, receive credit for all their service, including any pre-1969 service. Specific legislation granted limited credit for those who had only pre-1969 National Guard Technician service. This service can be verified by contacting the Adjutant General’s office for the State National Guard unit with which the individual served.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Nonappropriated Fund Employment (NAF)

[Section 6312(a)(2) of title 5](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title5/pdf/USCODE-2011-title5-partIII-subpartE-chap63-subchapI-sec6312.pdf), United States Code, as amended by [section 7202 of the Portability of Benefits for Nonappropriated Fund Employees Act of 1990](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/3139?s=1&r=18) ([Public Law 101-508](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/comp2/F101-508.html)) dated November 5, 1990) authorizes credit for leave accrual purposes for NAF service of employees who move on or after January 1, 1987, from Department of Defense NAF employment to Department of Defense civil service employment, or from Coast Guard NAF employment to Coast Guard civil service employment without a break in service of more than three calendar days. Once credited, this service remains creditable during any subsequent period of civil service employment. Periods of NAF employment under retained civil service retirement coverage are creditable for leave accrual. Other NAF service performed between 1952 and 1966 may also be creditable ([Public Law 99-638](https://www.congress.gov/99/statute/STATUTE-100/STATUTE-100-Pg3535.pdf)). For information on this service, refer to [Chapter 20 of The CSRS and FERS Handbook](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c020.pdf). Documents to verify NAF employment are in the NAF personnel folder. Request the folder by following instructions in [The Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/personnel-recordkeeping/recguide2011.pdf).

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. VISTA Volunteer Service.

Service performed on and after October 1, 1973, is creditable if the person was enrolled as a volunteer for a period of at least one year. The volunteer did not have to complete the enrollment, but the enrollment had to be for a period of a year or more. The Corporation for National Service verifies VISTA volunteer service. The verification should include the date of enrollment, length of enrollment period, date of assignment to service, and date of termination of training or service. This information is available from: AMERICORPS\*VISTA, 1201 New York Ave, NW., Room 9214C, Washington, DC 20525.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Peace Corps Volunteer Service.

Satisfactory volunteer service with the Peace Corps is creditable. The training prior to enrolling as a volunteer is not creditable; only actual volunteer time is creditable. Verification of satisfactory volunteer Peace Corps service is available from: Volunteer Staff & Payroll Services, The Peace Corps, Washington, DC 20526. >Volunteer Certifications of Service can also be obtained on the [Return Peace Corps Volunteer (RPCV) Portal](https://rpcvportal.peacecorps.gov/login/?returnurl=%2f).

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Prior non-Federal Service or Active-Duty Uniformed Service that otherwise would not be creditable.

Under [section 6303(e) of title 5, United States Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2015-title5/pdf/USCODE-2015-title5-partIII-subpartE-chap63-subchapI-sec6303.pdf), as amended by [Section 202(a) of the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/129) ([Pub. Law 108-411](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-108publ411/pdf/PLAW-108publ411.pdf) dated October 30, 2004), a newly appointed or reappointed employee or a retired member of the active duty uniformed service to receive credit for prior non-Federal service or active-duty uniformed service that otherwise would not be creditable. Credit granted under this provision can only be applied upon appointment or reappointment (following a break in service of at least 90 calendar days from the last period of Federal civilian employee) to a position on or after April 28, 2005. An employee has no entitlement to such credit. This discretionary hiring authority requires that the head of the agency or designee determine that the skills and experience the employee possess were acquired through performance in a non-Federal or active duty uniformed service position having duties which directly relate to the duties of the position to which he or she was appointed and are necessary to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal and must approve the employee’s qualifying prior work experience before the employee enters on duty. The amount of service credit that may be granted is at the sole and exclusive discretion of the head of the agency or designee; however, the amount of service may not exceed the actual amount of service during which duties directly related to the position for which being appointed were performed. Agencies must document the granting of such creditable service on the following forms: 1. [SF-144A](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144a.pdf) or an agency equivalent form used in lieu of the [SF-144A](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144a.pdf). Such credit is granted in terms of years and months, and the exact number of years and months of credit granted is recorded in Part I, Column B, of the [SF-144A](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf144a.pdf). See [Table 6-A](#_>table_6-a._) for appropriate remarks. ([https://www.chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/trans607.pdf](<https://www.chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/trans607.pdf)>)) 1. [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf). The period of service being credited must be included in the [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf) that effects the appointment of the individual with the agency. Remark codes B73, B74, and M39 (include in remark M39 the total of all periods of active duty uniformed service for which the employee is receiving credits towards the Service Computation Date for leave (SCD-Leave)) also must be included on the [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf), as appropriate. See [Table 6-A](#table_6-a._) for appropriate remarks.
