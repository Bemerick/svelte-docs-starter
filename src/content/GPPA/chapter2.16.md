# Return to Duty from Nonpay Status (Nature of Action 280 and 292)

## 1. Coverage

1.  This chapter covers actions that bring an employee back to pay status and duty after a 460/LWOP, 473/Absent-Uniformed Service, 430/Placement in Nonpay Status, 472/Furlough NTE, or a 450 Suspension Action.
1.  This chapter does not cover return to duty from:
    1. A brief period of leave without pay for which no Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel Action, was processed; a Standard Form 50 for a return to duty is not needed in these cases.
    1. Other paid leave, such as annual leave granted for a vacation or sick leave. A Standard Form 50 is not issued for these purposes.
    1. Discontinuous furlough or discontinuous suspension; a Standard Form 50 for return to duty is not needed in these cases.

## 2. When to Process a Return to Duty

1.  You must process a return to duty action whenever an employee returns from a nonpay status that was documented by a Standard Form 50, except as noted in 1b(3) above and as referenced in Note 3 of Table 16-A.  If an employee is approved leave through the Leave Transfer Program ([5 CFR 630.901](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-630/subpart-I/section-630.901)) while on leave without pay that was documented by a Standard Form 50, a return to duty action must be processed prior to placing that person on paid leave.

## 3. Instructions

1.  Compare data on the Standard Form 52, Request for Personnel Action, submitted by requesting office with the last action in the employee’s Official Personnel Folder to be sure they are correct.
1.  Use job aid, **Effect of Nonpay Status on Service Dates**, to decide if service dates will change due to the length of time the employee was in nonpay status.  If the service computation date for leave accrual (SCD-leave) will change, compute the new one and enter it in item 31 of the Standard Form 52 and in any suspense date system your agency maintains.
1.  Follow instructions in [The Federal Employees’ Health Benefits Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/reference-materials/fehb-handbook) to take action on health benefits by which the employee was covered before the period of time in nonpay status began.  Follow instructions in [The Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance - Handbook for Employees, Annuitants, Compensationers and Employing Offices](http://www.opm.gov/insure/life/handbook/index.asp) to take action if employee had life insurance coverage.
1.  Use Table 16-A to select nature of action and authority for the action and put them in blocks 5A-F of the Standard Form 52.  If the action is being taken under an authority that is unique to your department or agency, cite that authority (along with the authority code approved by the office of Personnel Management) instead of the authority and code shown in this chapter.
1.  Use Table 16-B to select the remarks/remarks codes required by the Office of Personnel Management for the action and enter them in Part F.  Also enter in Part F any additional remarks/remarks codes that are required by your agency’s instructions or that are necessary to explain the action.
1.  If another action is effective on the same date as the return to duty, use the chapter that covers the second action to select the nature of action, authority and remarks for the second action.  Document them in blocks 6A-F and Part F of the return to duty action or on a separate action.  If both actions are documented on the same Standard Form 50, show in blocks 15-22 the position and pay to which the second action moves the employee.
1.  Complete Standard Form 52 as required by instructions in Chapter 4.  Follow your agency’s instructions to obtain approval signature in Part C, block 2 of the Standard Form 52.
1.  Follow instructions in Chapter 4 to complete the Standard Form 50.  Follow your agency’s instructions to have it signed or authenticated.
1.  Update any suspense dates in any reminder system your agency uses.  These dates may include:
    1. ending date for trial or probationary period;
    1. date for change in tenure action; or
    1. date eligible for within-grade increase.
1.  Check [The Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping](http://www.opm.gov/feddata/persdoc.asp) to decide if any of the documents submitted with or created in connection with the action should be filed on the right side of the Official Personnel Folder.  Follow your agency’s instructions to dispose of those not filed in the folder.
1.  Prepare and distribute required notices.\*\*  Follow your agency’s instructions to distribute documentation of the personnel action.
